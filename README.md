# Shader-Graph

Welcome to the Shader-Graph repository! This repository contains a collection of shader graphs, focusing on different visual effects such as dissolve shaders and more, useful for graphics enthusiasts and game developers.

## Overview

Each folder in this repository represents a unique shader graph example:

- **Dissolve Shader** - Creates a dissolve effect, useful for transitions or material changes in games.
